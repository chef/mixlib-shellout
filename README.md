# Mixlib::ShellOut

[![Build Status](https://badge.buildkite.com/7051b7b35cc19076c35a6e6a9e996807b0c14475ca3f3acd86.svg?branch=main)](https://buildkite.com/chef-oss/chef-mixlib-shellout-master-verify) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mixlib-shellout.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mixlib-shellout)

**Umbrella Project**: [Chef Foundation](https://github.com/chef/chef-oss-practices/blob/master/projects/chef-foundation.md)

Provides a simplified interface to shelling out while still collecting both standard out and standard error and providing full control over environment, working directory, uid, gid, etc.

## Example
### Simple Shellout
Invoke find(1) to search for .rb files:

```ruby
  require 'mixlib/shellout'
  find = Mixlib::ShellOut.new("find . -name '*.rb'")
  find.run_command
```

If all went well, the results are on `stdout`

```ruby
  puts find.stdout
```

`find(1)` prints diagnostic info to STDERR:

```ruby
  puts "error messages" + find.stderr
```

Raise an exception if it didn't exit with 0

```ruby
  find.error!
```

### Advanced Shellout
In addition to the command to run there are other options that can be set to change the shellout behavior. The complete list of options can be found here: https://github.com/chef/mixlib-shellout/blob/master/lib/mixlib/shellout.rb

Run a command as the `www` user with no extra ENV settings from `/tmp` with a 1s timeout

```ruby
  cmd = Mixlib::ShellOut.new("apachectl", "start", :user => 'www', :environment => nil, :cwd => '/tmp', :timeout => 1)
  cmd.run_command # etc.
```

### STDIN Example
Invoke crontab to edit user cron:

```ruby
  # :input only supports simple strings
  crontab_lines = [ "* * * * * /bin/true", "* * * * * touch /tmp/here" ]
  crontab = Mixlib::ShellOut.new("crontab -l -u #{@new_resource.user}", :input => crontab_lines.join("\n"))
  crontab.run_command
```

### Windows Impersonation Example
Invoke "whoami.exe" to demonstrate running a command as another user:

```ruby
  whoami = Mixlib::ShellOut.new("whoami.exe", :user => "username", :domain => "DOMAIN", :password => "password")
  whoami.run_command
```

Invoke "whoami.exe" with elevated privileges:

```ruby
  whoami = Mixlib::ShellOut.new("whoami.exe", :user => "username", :domain => "DOMAIN", :password => "password", :elevated => true)
  whoami.run_command
```

**NOTE:** The user 'admin' must have the 'Log on as a batch job' permission and the user chef is running as must have the 'Replace a process level token' and 'Adjust Memory Quotas for a process' permissions.

## Platform Support
Mixlib::ShellOut does a standard fork/exec on Unix, and uses the Win32 API on Windows. There is not currently support for JRuby.
