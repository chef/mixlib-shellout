# GitHub Copilot Instructions for mixlib-shellout

## Repository Overview

**mixlib-shellout** is a Ruby library that provides a simplified interface to shelling out while collecting both standard out and standard error, and providing full control over environment, working directory, uid, gid, etc. It's part of the Chef ecosystem and provides cross-platform command execution capabilities.

## Jira Integration Workflow

When a Jira ID is provided:

1. **Use the Atlassian MCP Server** to fetch issue details:
   ```bash
   # The atlassian-mcp-server should be configured and available
   # Use the MCP tools to fetch Jira issue information
   ```

2. **Read and analyze the Jira story** to understand:
   - Requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Technical specifications
   - Expected behavior changes
   - Impact on existing functionality

3. **Implement the task** following the story requirements:
   - Make necessary code changes in `lib/mixlib/shellout/` 
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Unix/Windows)
   - Follow existing code patterns and style

## Testing Requirements

### Coverage Standards
- **Maintain > 80% test coverage** at all times
- Run coverage reports using: `bundle exec rspec --format documentation`
- All new features must include comprehensive test cases

### Test Structure
- **Unit tests**: Place in `spec/mixlib/shellout_spec.rb` or appropriate subdirectory
- **Platform-specific tests**: Use `spec/mixlib/shellout/windows_spec.rb` for Windows-only features
- **Helper tests**: Place helper function tests in `spec/mixlib/shellout/helper_spec.rb`

### Test Categories
Use RSpec filters appropriately:
- `:windows_only` - Windows-specific functionality
- `:unix_only` - Unix/Linux-specific functionality  
- `:linux_only` - Linux-specific functionality
- `:requires_root` - Tests requiring root privileges
- `:external` - Tests requiring external dependencies

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rake spec

# Run specific platform tests
bundle exec rspec --tag unix_only
bundle exec rspec --tag windows_only

# Run with coverage
bundle exec rspec --format documentation
```

## DCO Compliance Requirements

All commits must include a **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off**:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"

# Or add manually to commit message:
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

**DCO Requirements:**
- Every commit must be signed off
- Use your real name (no pseudonyms)
- Use your actual email address
- Indicates you have the right to contribute the code
- Confirms you agree to the DCO terms

## Build System Integration

### Expeditor Configuration
The repository uses **Expeditor** for automated CI/CD:

- **Main config**: `.expeditor/config.yml`
- **Build pipeline**: `.expeditor/verify.pipeline.yml`
- **Notifications**: Sent to `#chef-found-notify` Slack channel
- **Auto-versioning**: Supports major/minor version bumps via labels

### GitHub Actions
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/ci-main-pull-request-checks.yml`
- **Triggers**: Pull requests and pushes to `main` and `release/**` branches
- **Features**: Complexity checks, TruffleHog scanning, SBOM generation

### Available Build Commands
```bash
# Run tests locally
bundle exec rake spec

# Generate documentation  
bundle exec rake rdoc

# Build gem
gem build mixlib-shellout.gemspec

# Install locally for testing
gem install ./mixlib-shellout-*.gem
```

## Pull Request Creation Workflow

### Branch Naming
- **Use Jira ID as branch name** (e.g., `COOK-1234` or `CHEF-5678`)
- For non-Jira work: Use descriptive names (e.g., `fix-windows-timeout`, `improve-error-handling`)

### PR Creation Process

1. **Create and switch to feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b JIRA-ID
   # Example: git checkout -b CHEF-1234
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit with DCO**:
   ```bash
   # Make your changes
   git add .
   git commit -s -m "Fix shellout timeout handling on Windows
   
   - Improved error detection for timeout scenarios
   - Added proper cleanup for hung processes
   - Updated Windows-specific error messages
   
   Fixes CHEF-1234"
   ```

3. **Push branch and create PR using GitHub CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Push the branch
   git push origin JIRA-ID
   
   # Create PR with proper description
   gh pr create --title "JIRA-ID: Brief description" --body "$(cat <<EOF
   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>Brief description of changes made</p>
   
   <h2>Changes Made</h2>
   <ul>
   <li>Specific change 1</li>

## Workflow Rules and Guidelines

### File Modification Restrictions
- **Never modify**: 
  - `.expeditor/config.yml` (without explicit approval)
  - Version files (handled automatically by Expeditor)
  - License files
  - GitHub workflow files (without security review)

### Code Style Guidelines
- Follow existing Ruby style conventions in the codebase
- Use 2-space indentation
- Keep method complexity low
- Add comprehensive documentation for public APIs
- Follow the existing error handling patterns

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- Always consider Windows and Unix implementations
- Use platform-specific modules when necessary (`unix.rb`, `windows.rb`)
- Test platform-specific code paths
- Handle platform differences gracefully

### Security Considerations
- Validate all external inputs
- Properly escape shell commands
- Handle file permissions correctly
- Follow secure coding practices for shell execution

## Prompt-Based Development Guidelines

### After Each Step
Always provide a summary and ask for continuation:
```markdown
**Step Summary**: [What was accomplished]  
**Next Step**: [What comes next]
**Remaining Steps**: [What's left to do]
**Continue?**: Should I proceed with [next step]?
```

### Decision Points
When encountering ambiguity:
```markdown  
**Decision Needed**: [Description of the decision point]
**Options**: 
1. [Option 1 with pros/cons]
2. [Option 2 with pros/cons]

**Recommendation**: [Your recommendation with reasoning]
**Should I proceed with the recommended approach?**
```

### Error Handling
When encountering issues:
```markdown
**Issue Encountered**: [Description of the problem]
**Attempted Solutions**: [What was tried]  
**Proposed Resolution**: [How to fix it]
**Impact**: [How this affects the overall task]

**Should I proceed with the proposed resolution?**
```

## MCP Server Integration

### Atlassian MCP Server Usage
The repository is configured to use the `atlassian-mcp-server` for Jira integration:

1. **Fetch Issue Details**:
   ```javascript
   // Use MCP tools to get Jira issue information
   // Example: mcp_atlassian-mcp_getJiraIssue
   ```

2. **Issue Analysis**:
   - Extract requirements from issue description
   - Identify acceptance criteria  
   - Understand technical specifications
   - Note any dependencies or blockers

3. **Progress Updates**:
   - Update Jira issue with progress comments
   - Link commits and PR to the issue
   - Update issue status as appropriate

### Available MCP Tools
- `mcp_atlassian-mcp_getJiraIssue` - Get issue details
- `mcp_atlassian-mcp_addCommentToJiraIssue` - Add progress comments
- `mcp_atlassian-mcp_transitionJiraIssue` - Update issue status
- `mcp_atlassian-mcp_search` - Search for related issues

Remember to use these tools to maintain traceability between code changes and Jira issues throughout the development process.
